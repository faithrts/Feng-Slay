## What is it?
We've all been there: moving into a new apartment, taking stock of existing furniture, and somehow formulating an aesthetic floorplan. Sometimes we succeed in creating a relatively nice space, but most times we fall prey to one of many Feng Shui no-nos. With a crowded desk comes decreased mindfulness; with a vulnerable bed comes broken sleep. But who has the time to arrange and rearrange their room ad infinitum?

The idea of our solution is to facilitate room organization based on Feng Shui principles :)
